# About  

This package is the beginning of Better BikeReg.com

# Reason for Creation

Currently, the search functionality of Bike Reg for events is limited to basic filters (i.e. event type, distance from location). 
To create a better user experience, the BikeReg API is utilized to create a database of events. FastAPI will be used to interact with
the database and to power a front-end that will allow for advanced filter. The results will be shown on a map for easier viewing.
