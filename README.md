# About  

This package is the beginning of Better BikeReg.com

# Reason for Creation

Currently, the search functionality of Bike Reg for events is limited to basic filters (i.e. event type, distance from location). To create a better user experience, the BikeReg API is utilized to create a database of events

The website will provide better search functionality to events
